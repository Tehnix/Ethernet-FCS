#Ethernet FCS 
Ethernet FCS exercise for course 34349: FPGA design for communication technology at the Technical University of Denmark.


The accompanying report goes through the following:

## Task 1
Generate the VHDL for an entity, *fcs\_check\_serial* code that checks an Ethernet packet for bit errors, assuming a serial stream

## Task 2
Synthesize and perform a Place & Route on the *fcs\_check\_serial* entity.

## Task 3
Generate a testbench for the *fcs\_check\_serial* entity.

## Task 4
Redesign the *fcs\_check\_serial* and make it parallel, calling it *fcs\_check\_parallel*. Do task 2 and 3 also for the new entity.
